    "<p>According to the Coffee Association of Canada, in a 2017 study, 71% of participants responded that they had consumed coffee the previous day. This presents a huge opportunity for potential business owners wanting to open a coffee house.</p>\n",
    "<p>This report will serve such entreprenerus and will aim to identity which areas in Toronto present the most opportunity for opening a coffee house. It will attempt to identify which areas are already saturated with coffee houses and which areas are lacking. The areas that are lacking will likely have the most potential.</p>"
