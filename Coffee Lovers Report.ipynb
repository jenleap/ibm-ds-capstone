    "<p>Distribution of coffee locations and population may not be the only factors to take into consideration when looking at neighborhoods. If we have a neighborhood with few coffee locations, it may be indicative that the neighborhood has little interest in coffee (or perhaps little interest in purchasing their coffee from a coffee house). While this report provides a solid starting to place to narrow down potential neighborhoods, more research should be done in order to understand the population where a potential coffee house would be opened. Demographics of these neighborhoods might be investigated more thoroughly; factors such as income and crime rate could effect the success of coffee houses in the neighborhood.</p>"
